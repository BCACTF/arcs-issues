This repository is used for collecting suggestions, fixes, and feature requests for ARCS.

Some things to note when writing an issue:
- Check for similar issues first.
  - If the concept falls under another issue, maybe comment on that one instead.
  - If your issue isn't fully covered by related issues, feel free to make a separate one.
- Give relevant examples if possible.
  - A lot of issues are edge cases, and we can't do much if we don't know what that edge is.
- Don't make your issues too specific or too general
  - We don't need issues like:
    - *"The contrast on this button has to be increased slightly."*
      - Maybe look for or make a general accessibility notes issue!
    - *"I think you should start building ARCS again from the ground up."*
      - Look, that's not what this repository is for. Constructive
      - If it very clearly doesn't fit with where ARCS is going – and you still think it might be helpful – then feel free to talk to us privately.
- Let us know about any other things we should know about this!

Okay. Thank you, and have a great rest of your life!

*~The ARCS team.*
